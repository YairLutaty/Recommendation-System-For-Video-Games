# Recommendation System for Video Games  

This project was developed as part of my **Data Science Workshop** at the Open University of Israel.  
It explores how **machine learning and recommender systems** can be applied in the video game industry to improve player experience and support business goals.  

The focus is on designing a system that can recommend **the 10 most relevant games for each user** ‚Äî not just predicting ratings, but identifying games that a user is **most likely to purchase**.

## Project Goals  

- Build a **recommendation system** tailored for video games, a domain with unique challenges compared to movies or music (e.g., games are longer, expensive, and more diverse in style).  
- Explore different recommendation approaches:  
  - **Collaborative Filtering** (learning from user‚Äìitem interactions)  
  - **Content-Based Filtering** (using game metadata & embeddings)  
  - **Hybrid methods** (combining both)  
- Incorporate **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** by analyzing review texts and sentiments to better capture player opinions.  
- Evaluate recommendations not only by accuracy, but also by **hit rate** and **purchase likelihood**.

## üìä Dataset  

We use the [Amazon Reviews 2023 ‚Äì Video Games subset](https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/):  

- **~50K reviews** of video games, all marked as confirmed purchases.  
- Each review contains:  
  - ‚≠ê Rating  
  - üìù Review text + embeddings  
  - ‚úÖ Sentiment (predicted via Hugging Face models)  
- Metadata includes:  
  - üéÆ Game title and description  
  - üì¶ Features (platform, genre, publisher, etc.)  
  - üîó Description embeddings (1024-d vectors for similarity search)  

Users on average review ~5 games, giving us enough history for training and evaluation.

## What We Explore  

1. **Recommendation Accuracy**  
   - Does collaborative filtering outperform content-based methods?  
   - How effective are hybrid approaches?  

2. **Purchase Prediction**  
   - Can we ensure at least one recommendation per user matches a real purchase from the test set?  
   - How well do models capture user intent beyond ratings?  

3. **User Behavior Insights**  
   - What trends exist in player preferences across genres/platforms?  
   - How do sentiment scores align with numerical ratings?  

4. **Business Perspective**  
   - How can recommendations increase the likelihood of purchase?  
   - Which recommendation strategies are most suitable for video game platforms (e.g., Steam, Xbox Store)?

## üìñ About the Notebook  

The main work is in **`Data_Science_Workshop.ipynb`**, but GitHub‚Äôs viewer cannot fully render it due to the use of **ipywidgets** (interactive visualizations).  
To make the project accessible, three versions are provided:  

### 1. Code-Only (GitHub-Friendly) Notebook  
- **`Data_Science_Workshop_no_outputs.ipynb`**  
- Contains all code and explanations.  
- Opens on GitHub without issues.  
- No executed outputs or widget interactivity.  

### 2. Full Notebook (with Outputs & Widgets)  
- **`Data_Science_Workshop.ipynb`**  
- Contains the **complete workflow**: preprocessing, visualizations, recommendation models, widgets.  
- May not render properly on GitHub.  

### 3. Full Notebook (Online via nbviewer)  
[View the full notebook on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/YairLutaty/Recommendation-System-For-Video-Games/blob/main/Data_Science_Workshop.ipynb)  
- Supports rendered outputs and widget states.
